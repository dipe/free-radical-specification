Introduction {#intro}
=====================

Technical projects increasingly face contradictions in decision-making,
methodology and choice of technology.

This development takes place in an environment where technical advancement
is considerably accelerating, which makes decision making harder and harder:
Adopting new methodology and technology for their
benefits versus using known approaches and techniques.

In order to help teams advance in an ordered and sustainable manner, the
