*   [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)

## Getting started

To modify the specification, you'll need some local tooling installed.
Follow these steps to get up and running in a breeze.

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/sinnerschrader/free-radical-specification.git
cd free-radical-specification
npm install
npm start
```

## Writing the specification

All specification sources are written in the
[bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed)
format. See the documentation there for details.

`free-radical-specification` enforces a set of conventions.
Read the [contribution guide](./contributing.md) for more
information.

## Installation troubleshooting

`free-radical-specification` depends on
[bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed),
which is a python tool assuming the presence of external libraries.

Most notably it requires `libxml2` and `libxslt`. Ensure you use the correct
versions of the libraries by installing them via your package manager.

On Mac OSX you might have to execute the following commands to do so:

```bash
brew install libxml2 libxslt
brew link libxml2 --force
brew link libxslt --force
```
