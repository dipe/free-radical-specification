# Free Radical

This specification defines a framework for implementation of the Free Radical Role. It does so by defining desired effects and requirements for employees and their work in order to fulfill the Free Radical Role.

## Introduction

Technical projects increasingly face contradictions in decision-making,
methodology and choice of technology.

This class of problem arises from contradictory requirements and pressure
factors, which can be simplified as monetary aspects on one side and
ever higher requirements to reliability and quality of the software technical
teams ultimately produce.

This development takes place in an environment where technical advancement
is considerably accelerating, which puts additional contradictions into
potential making: Adopting new methodology and technology for their
benefits versus using known approaches and techniques.

In order to help teams advance in an ordered and sustainable manner, the
creation of a <a>Free Radical</a> role is proposed.

## Terminology

<dfn>Free Radical</dfn> defines a role employees working in software development
can take on. Organizations implementing the <a>Free Radical</a> role can
assume certain <a href="#effects">desirable effects</a> taking hold.
The role comes with a distinct set of liberties and requirements.
The <a href="#conditions">Frame conditions</a> to set for efficient
implementations and the <a href="#requirements">Requirements</a> an employee
taking on the role has to fulfill are described in separate sections of this document.

## Scope

The scope of this specification is limited to the definition of the very minimum
of a framework for the role of a Free Radical.

It does not contain any concrete workflow examples, cases, constraints or
rules for day-to-day work.

The <a>Free Radical</a> role can be implemented in various disciplines – this
specification describes the role in the scope of employees working in software
development.

## Desired Effects

<i>This section is non-normative</i>

The <a>Free Radical</a> role is defined as to achieve the following desirable
effects:

-   General technical advancement of the company
-   General methodological advancement of the company
-   Mid- and longterm productivity gains
-   Improved reliability and quality of software projects
-   Distribution of advanced technology knowledge
-   Timely utilization and trial of new technology and its potential benefits
-   Sustained attractiveness of projects and company for new and present employees

## Tasks

<a>Free Radical</a>s <strong>MUST</strong> take on the following tasks in their day-to-day work:

-   General consulting on technical matters
-   Sparring on technical implementations and decisions for all other employees. This explicitly includes non-technical staff.
-   General development work, aiming at establishing Best Practices by example
-   Implementation and documentation of technical project setups
-   Introduction of new technology in projects
-   Knowledge Transfer about technical matters, especially introduced setups and technology

<a>Free Radical</a>s <strong>SHOULD</strong> take on the following tasks as they see fit:

-   Support and implementation of Open Source Software
-   Introduction of new methodology in technical problem spaces
-   Presentations and talks inside and outside of the company

## Requirements

Employees striving to fulfill the <a>Free Radical</a> role <b>MUST</b> have
the following abilities:

-   Broad technical knowledge on senior level
-   Ability to draft and implement sound technical concepts
-   Excellent general problem-solving capabilities
-   High capacity for learning new concepts and techniques
-   Ability to communicate and convince others of new techniques, methods and concept
-   Excellent skills in delivery and implementation
-   Good abilities in explaining solutions and techniques to others
-   Ability to reason about technical solutions in a nuanced and pragmatic manner

Additionally <a>Free Radical</a>s <b>SHOULD</b> sport the following attributes
and qualities

-   High interest in solving problems and making things work
-   Distinct motivation to improve upon existing solutions
-   Readiness to learn far beyond the personal horizon
-   Courage to assume calculated risks
-   Capabilities to to think outside of traditional and present boundaries
-   Strong sense for opportunities and risks of applied technology

## Frame conditions

For efficient implementation of the <a>Free Radical</a> role the following
frame conditions <strong>SHOULD</strong> be met:

-   <a>Free Radical</a>s decide independently on their involvement in projects
-   Projects avoid planning with <a>Free Radical</a>s as permanent project members
-   <a>Free Radical</a>s account only partially for their productive work times
-   <a>Free Radical</a>s have the liberties to take calculated risks in their field of work
-   <a>Free Radical</a>s are directly available for questions and sparring to other employees

## Mission statement

Technology is great. We firmly believe there is more to building
software than to making it work one way or the other.

There are always elegant patterns to sculpt, bytes to shove off and complexities
to simplify. We work hard to do exactly that and spread the knowledge about it to everyone.

Good solutions and new paths do not come without dangers. Things will go wrong –
we know that and will account for the risks.

Because exploring the best solution is so much fun, we fight for it.
Every day, radically and courageously.

## Supporting Measures

To help an efficient and successful implementation of the <a>Free Radical</a>
role a range of additional measures can be taken.

-   Regular surveys inquiring about the perceived performance of <a>Free Radicals</a>
-   Transparency about the current work of <a>Free Radicals</a>, e.g. by publishing it on blogs
-   Regular updates on the self-improvement efforts undertaken by <a>Free Radical</a>
