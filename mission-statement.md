# Mission statement

Technology is great. We firmly believe there is more to building
software than to making it work one way or the other.

There are always elegant patterns to sculpt, bytes to shove off and complexities
to simplify. We work hard to do exactly that and spread the knowledge about it to everyone.

Good solutions and new paths do not come without dangers. Things will go wrong –
we know that and will account for the risks. New paths will be hard and inconvenient –
we accept these hardships to create the best projects possible, for our colleagues and customers.

We take on the hard fights. Most of the time we go where the big and hard problems are, this includes
projects with unwieldy legacy code bases, encrusted processes or gigantic scopes.

Because exploring the best solution is so much fun, we fight for it.
Every day, radically and courageously.
