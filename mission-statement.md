# Mission statement

Technology is great. We believe there is more to building
software than making it work one way or the other.

There are elegant patterns to sculpt, bytes to shove off and complexities
to simplify. We work hard to do that and spread the knowledge about it.

Good solutions and new paths do not come without dangers. Things will go wrong –
we know that and will account for the risks. New paths are inconvenient –
we accept the hardships to create the best projects, for our colleagues and customers.

We take on the hard fights.
We tame unwieldy legacy code bases,
force open encrusted processes and
deconstruct gigantic scopes.
We go where the big and daunting problems are.

Because exploring the best solution is so much fun, we fight for it.
Every day, radically and courageously.
